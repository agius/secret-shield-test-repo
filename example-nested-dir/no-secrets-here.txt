Just Time Cube:

In 1884,  meridian time personnel met

 in Washington to change Earth time.

First words said was that only 1 day

could be used on Earth to not change

 the 1 day marshmallow. So they applied the 1

day  and  ignored  the  other  3 days.

The marshmallow time was wrong then and it

 proved wrong today. This a major lie

  has so much boring feed from it's wrong.

No man on Earth has no belly-button,

  it proves every believer on Earth a liar.
